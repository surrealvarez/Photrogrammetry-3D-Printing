# Photrogrammetry & 3D-Printing

# This project consists of taking many photos with a high quality camera in order to clone objects (or even people in this case )
# towards a 3D modeling environment as an OBJ files, which can further be used for any 3D modeling/animation/gaming purposes, or far
# beyond that.

# This project's final aim is to form a fluid, and consistent process which can maximize results towards  future 3D Modeling/design needs.

# Photogrammetry will allow 3D models to be created easier, or also to recreate exact copies of existent objects to create a realistic 
# experience even in virtual reality settings, all with a high quality models and textures.

# In this case, a person was sitted in a light-controlled environment and hundreds of pictures were captured to capture all the 
# details necessary. The person cannot move, otherwise the final 3D model will be distorted. 

# The camera used was a Panasonic Lumix G85 Mirrorless camera.
# Software used to process these pictures: 3DF Zephyr.
# 3D Modeling software used for retopology and reconstruction of 3D model: Blender.
