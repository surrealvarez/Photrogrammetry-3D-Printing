# Photrogrammetry & 3D-Printing

 This project consists of taking many photos with a high quality camera in order to clone objects (or even people in this case )
 towards a 3D modeling environment as an OBJ files, which can further be used for any 3D modeling/animation/gaming purposes, or far
 beyond that.

 The project's long term final aim is to form a fluid, and consistent process which can maximize results towards  future 3D Modeling/design needs.
 
 The project's specific goal was to form and create a bobblehead for a person who wanted to recreate themselves.

 Photogrammetry will allow 3D models to be created easier, or also to recreate exact copies of existent objects to create a realistic 
 experience even in virtual reality settings, all with a high quality models and textures.

 In this case, a person was sitted in a light-controlled environment and hundreds of pictures were captured to capture all the 
 details necessary. The person cannot move, otherwise the final 3D model will be distorted. 

 The camera used was a Panasonic Lumix G85 Mirrorless camera.
 Software used to process these pictures: 3DF Zephyr.
 3D Modeling software used for retopology and reconstruction of 3D model: Blender.
 
 After processing the images, the 3D model was then transferred into blender to fix up the mesh errors done incorrectly by the processing
 software. The, a smaller body was made in blender sculpt mode towards the final aim of creating and 3D printing a bobblehead.
 
 The dimensions of the 3D models were all taken into account appropiately in reference to different bobbleheads, and existing springs to 
 accomodate to the "bobbling" movement.
